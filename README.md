# SafeBase64EncodeDecode
A base64 encoder/decoder that runs locally with no online interation.

Sometimes I need to create a base64-encoded Bearer token for REST API calls, and it consists of a username/password.
I don't trust online encoders/decoders to be responsible with this information so I wrote my own.
